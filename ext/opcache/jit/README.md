# zend\_jit\_experement

This branch contains PoC implementaton of transparent JIT for PHP.
JIT is implemented as a part of OPCache. It doesn't require any changes in the PHP engine itself and should be 100% comatible by design.
JIT uses LLVM as a backend. It was tested on x86 and x86_64 platforms.

# Build

PHP should be configured and built with the following options (last two are optional).
LLVM code base is not stable. There are some incompatibilities between version. I would recomend to use LLVM-3.5 to avoid comptibility problems.

  - --enable-jit
  - --with-llvm=/usr/local/llvm-3.5'
  - --with-valgrind
  - --with-oprofile

# Configure

To enable JIT, in addition to usual opcache ini directives add a new one:

  - opcache.jit_buffer_size=32M
  
Of course, you may use different setting for code buffer size.

# Performance

JIT provides more than 5 times speedup on bench.php (30 times on some specific benchmarks like Mandelbrot).

Unfortunately, JIT doesn't improve performance of real life apps. Also LLVM compilation time is not suatable for run-time code generation (it make take few minutes).

# Discovering

It's possible to get various infirmediate information to understand what the JIT does. You may use opcache.jit_debug ini option to dump it. For example the folowing command will dump the assembler code generated for bench.php. (each bit may turn some debug output, see JIT_DEBUG_DUMP_... constants in ext/opcache/jit/zend_jit_context.h).

php -d opcache.jit_debug=0x100 bench.php

# Future directions

It's possible to achive additional ~30% improvement on bench.php implementing interprocedure optimizations. We did it before (for PHP-5.5), but didn't adopted this part for PHP7 yet.
